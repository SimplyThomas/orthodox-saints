# Thematic Browsing — Design Spec (Feature B)

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Proposed — awaiting user review
**Relationship:** Feature B of two. Feature A (rich saint profiles, PR #157) shipped St. Basil's
profile with **non-linking** theme badges. Feature B makes themes a first-class, system-wide
facet and turns those badges into real links.

---

## 1. Goal

Help visitors discover saints by **theme** — life circumstances, vocations, virtues, struggles,
historical movements, relationships, miracles, and geography — rather than only by name or feast.
Concretely:

1. A derived `themes: string[]` on **every** saint record (the future-proofing the user asked for).
2. A **"Browse by Theme"** landing page of themed cards (name, description, saint count, link),
   grouped into the 8 theme groups.
3. A **per-theme listing** page (`/themes/<slug>`) — a filtered saint list reusing the finder.
4. **Theme badges on every saint page**, linking to `/themes/<slug>` (and repointing Basil's
   Feature-A profile badges to these links).
5. **Theme-based related saints** (by shared-theme overlap) on saint pages.
6. **Natural-language search aliases** so queries like "saints who were soldiers", "saints in
   america", "saints who defended icons" surface the matching theme.

## 2. Architecture (approved in brainstorm)

**Hybrid: derived + override.** Themes are computed at build time from a declarative taxonomy of
predicates over the controlled-vocab facets every saint already has. An optional `Themes` column in
`data/saints.csv` (semicolon-separated slugs) is **unioned in** for curated/non-derivable themes.

**Count-driven display.** The full taxonomy ships in code, but the landing page renders only themes
whose computed count > 0 — no dead "0 saints" cards. Override-only themes light up automatically as
the override column fills.

**Lightweight search aliases.** A small phrase→slug map folded into the existing client-side search;
no NLP, no new dependency.

```
data/saints.csv (facets + optional Themes override col)
      │
      ▼
build.py  ── compute_themes(record, TAXONOMY) ──► record["themes"] = [slug,…]   (every saint)
      │     └─ emits theme catalog: [{slug, group, label, desc, count}]          (themes.json or in data.json)
      ▼
public/data.json  ──(build-time import)──►  Astro:
      ├─ /themes               (landing: catalog grouped, counts)
      ├─ /themes/[slug]        (per-theme listing; reuses finder filtering on themes[])
      ├─ saint/[id]            (theme badges → /themes/<slug>; theme-based related saints)
      └─ search                (alias map: phrase → theme suggestion banner)
```

- The taxonomy + mapping is the **single source of truth**, authored once in Python (`build.py` or a
  new `themes.py` it imports). The catalog (slugs, labels, descriptions, groups, counts) is emitted
  to the frontend so pages render from data, not hardcoded lists.
- `themes` becomes a real **finder facet** (added to `FACETS` in `src/lib/filter.ts`), so `/themes/<slug>`
  is just the finder pre-seeded to one theme, and themes are also filterable on `/search`.

## 3. Rule schema

Each theme is `{ slug, group, label, desc, match }`. `match` is a list of **rules**; a saint gets the
theme if **any** rule matches (OR) — within a rule, **all** field conditions must hold (AND). A field
condition matches if the saint's value(s) for that field intersect the listed values. Fields are the
`data.json` record arrays/strings: `gender, rank, church, family, vocation, experience, virtue,
intercession, origin, tradition, era, century`.

```python
# themes.py
THEMES = [
  {"slug": "mothers", "group": "Life Circumstances", "label": "Mothers",
   "desc": "Holy women who raised children in the faith.",
   "match": [{"gender": ["Female"], "family": ["Parent"]}]},          # AND within rule
  {"slug": "healers", "group": "Miracles & Wonders", "label": "Healers",
   "desc": "Saints through whom God healed body and soul.",
   "match": [{"rank": ["Unmercenary"]}, {"vocation": ["Physician"]},   # OR across rules
             {"intercession": ["Healing"]}],
   ...},
  # override-only themes have "match": []  → populated solely via the Themes CSV column
]
```

A saint's final `themes` = `{slug for theme in THEMES if any_rule_matches(theme, record)} ∪ {slugs from the Themes override column}`. The override column is validated against the taxonomy slugs (unknown slug → build error, same as any vocab).

## 4. The taxonomy (complete; my judgment calls flagged ⚑)

Notation: `field∈{…}` means the saint's `field` intersects the set. Rules separated by `OR`.
**DERIVED** = has a `match`. **OVERRIDE** = `match: []`, filled only via the CSV column (renders once
populated; hidden at launch per the count>0 rule). **⚑** = a judgment call worth your review.

**Net:** ~80 themes derive from existing facets and will render at launch; ~30 are OVERRIDE-only
(hidden until curated) — concentrated in *Family & Relationships*, *Miracles* (relics/icons/visions),
and a handful of doctrine-specific Historical themes. Five requested names are merged duplicates
(`former-soldiers→soldiers`, `rulers→royal-saints`, `missionary-saints`/`evangelism→missionaries`,
`north-america→saints-of-america`, `defenders-of-the-faith→defenders-of-orthodoxy`).

## 5. Build changes (`build.py` / new `themes.py`)

- New `themes.py`: the `THEMES` taxonomy + `compute_themes(record) -> list[str]` + `theme_catalog(records) -> list[dict]` (slug/group/label/desc/count). Unit-tested.
- `build.py` `to_record()`: set `rec["themes"] = compute_themes(rec)` (union with the optional `Themes`
  override column, split on `"; "`).
- Add optional **`Themes`** as column 27 of `data/saints.csv` (back-compat: absent/blank = derived only).
  Validate override slugs against the taxonomy; unknown slug → build error with a "valid slugs are…" hint.
- Emit the theme catalog into `public/data.json` (e.g. a top-level `{ records: [...], themes: [...] }`
  OR a sibling `public/themes.json`). **Decision:** sibling `themes.json` to avoid touching the
  records-array shape the frontend already imports. ⚑ (open to in-data.json if preferred.)
- Coverage report: print theme counts (top N) like the existing finder-coverage report.

## 6. Frontend changes

- **`src/lib/types.ts`**: add `themes: string[]` to `Saint` (+ `FinderSaint`); add a `ThemeMeta`
  type `{slug, group, label, desc, count}`.
- **`src/lib/themes.ts`** (new): import the catalog; helpers `themeBySlug`, `themesByGroup`,
  `THEME_GROUPS` (ordered), `relatedByThemes(saint, all, n)` (rank others by shared-theme count).
- **`src/lib/filter.ts`**: add `{key:"themes", label:"Themes", multi:true}` to `FACETS` so the finder
  filters on `themes[]`.
- **`src/pages/themes.astro`** (new): landing — grouped theme cards (label, desc, count, link), each
  group with an Orthodox-manuscript accent. Count-driven: render only themes with count > 0.
- **`src/pages/themes/[slug].astro`** (new): `getStaticPaths` over the catalog; renders a themed
  header (label/desc/count) + the finder pre-seeded to that theme (reuse `Finder`/finder island, or a
  static list reusing the saint-row markup). Reuses existing pagination/sort.
- **`src/components/SiteHeader.astro`**: add nav `{ key:"themes", label:"Themes", href: withBase("themes") }`.
- **Saint pages — badges:** a "Themes" block on `SaintView` rendering `saint.themes` as `.tag`-style
  badges linking to `withBase("themes/"+slug)`. **Repoint Basil's Feature-A profile badges** in
  `SaintProfile.astro` to `/themes/<slug>` (map the profile's editorial labels to slugs; drop labels
  with no taxonomy slug or render them plain).
- **Saint pages — related:** a "Related saints" block from `relatedByThemes()` (top ~6 by shared-theme
  overlap), computed at build time (SSG has the full dataset; zero client payload). Complements Basil's
  curated `related` list.
- **Search aliases — `src/lib/theme-aliases.ts`** (new): `{ "soldiers":"soldiers", "in america":"saints-of-america",
  "defended icons":"icon-defenders", "mothers":"mothers", "exile":"exile", … }`. The finder island
  detects an alias hit in the query and shows a "Browse the **<label>** theme →" suggestion banner above
  results; theme labels also fold into the search haystack at build (append each saint's theme labels to
  its `search` string).

## 7. Testing

- **Python unit tests** (`tests/`): `compute_themes` on crafted records (each rule kind: single facet,
  AND-combination like Mothers/Desert-Fathers, OR-across-rules like Healers, override union, unknown
  override slug → error); `theme_catalog` counts; the OS-0021 Basil record carries expected derived
  slugs (bishops, hierarchs, monastics, theologians, asia-minor, byzantine-saints, …).
- **Playwright e2e** (`e2e/`): `/themes` renders grouped cards with counts and no count-0 card;
  clicking a card opens `/themes/<slug>` listing the right saints; a saint page shows theme badges
  linking to `/themes/<slug>`; Basil's profile badges now link; related-saints block renders; a search
  for "soldiers"/"in america" shows the theme suggestion banner. Nav "Themes" is base-prefixed.
- `make validate` clean; full build; lint; full e2e green; `data.json`/`themes.json` sane.

## 8. Build order (phased; each phase is shippable)

1. **Foundation** — `themes.py` taxonomy + `compute_themes` + `theme_catalog`, `Themes` override
   column, emit `themes.json`, Python tests, coverage report. (No UI yet.)
2. **Browse pages + nav** — `/themes` landing + `/themes/[slug]` + nav item + `themes` finder facet.
3. **Saint-page integration** — theme badges (+ repoint Basil's), theme-based related saints.
4. **Search aliases** — alias map + suggestion banner + haystack enrichment.

## 9. Guardrails / non-goals

- No new controlled-vocab *terms* in `vocabulary.csv` (themes are a separate taxonomy); the `Themes`
  override values are validated against the theme slugs.
- OVERRIDE-only themes stay hidden until curated — no empty cards (per the approved count>0 rule).
- Loose-proxy themes (⚑) are best-effort facets, not authoritative claims; same clergy/source-review
  caveat applies. The mapping is data, easily tuned later.
- Performance: `themes` adds a short string array per record; well within the ~5,000-saint inline
  ceiling noted in `search.astro`'s `TODO(scale)`.

## 10. Open questions for review

1. **Taxonomy judgment calls (⚑)** — especially the loose proxies (elderly→Grandparent,
   former-criminals→Repentance, family-conflict→Difficult Marriage, theologians→Scholar) and the
   merges. Keep, drop, or adjust any?
2. **Override-only at launch** — comfortable that ~30 themes (most of *Family & Relationships*,
   *Miracles* relics/icons/visions, doctrine-specific Historical) won't appear until curated?
3. **Catalog location** — sibling `themes.json` (recommended) vs. embedding in `data.json`.
4. **`/themes/[slug]` listing** — reuse the interactive finder island, or a simpler static pre-rendered
   list (lighter, but no client re-sort/filter)? Recommendation: static list reusing the saint-row
   markup, with a link to the full finder pre-filtered to that theme.
